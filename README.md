## Inspiration: The Problem and Why This Matters?

With the goal of promoting social change, we focused on the social implications of the current student recruiting process.
To identify the pain points and workflow of the recruitment, we interviewed Bill from Facebook. He helped us see the bigger issue of accessibility for non-traditional applicants, i.e. students who are not in top universities. We want to create a more equitable and inclusive future for all applicants. **Our new problem became:
How might we create a platform for recruiters to empower all types of applicants.**

## Personas

- Students of all backgrounds, including traditional and non-traditional applicants
- Recruiters

## Solution: dubForm

What if there was a tool that could streamline the entire recruitment process for all students and recruiters? Enter dubForm, the universal pipeline tool for finding the perfect job match for both traditional and non-traditional students.

## Features

- Universal _dubForm_ that matches a student's skills with a company's criteria (NO COPY + PASTE!)
- All-in-one progress dashboard with clear and easy to inspect checkpoints for all stages in the recruitment process
- Newsfeed of upcoming recruiting events in the area
- Company dashboard where recruiters can create and broadcast events as well as easily review status of job applicants
- Built-in coding challenges & phone interviews (all internal - no third-parties!)
- An easy to use and efficient recruitment pipeline that is _customizable_ per a company's specs!

## How we built it

We used React.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a connected web app using the react router dom to connect separate components

## Challenges we ran into

- Mastering DOM and managing state in React
- Working and styling with unfamiliar APIâ€™s
- Resolving merge conflicts in Git

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we addressed an existing issue that affects many people around us. We explored and analyzed the root problem by conducting UX interview with a Facebook Recruiter and traditional and non-traditional applicants. As a result, created a product that caters to the needs of the users, the applicants and the recruiters.

## What we learned

There are many similar challenges that both students and recruiters face in the hiring process (students not knowing where/when recruiting events will take place, companies not being able to broadcast their recruiting events effectively)
As a team we learned how to collaborate on git, manage state between different react components, render html in javascript in JSX,

## What's next for dubForm

Add user onboarding/registration/authentication
Implement matching algorithm business logic
Add data collection / logging of accounts and their progress with different companies
